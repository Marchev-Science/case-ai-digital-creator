# Autonomous Short-Form Video Factory with n8n + GPT

## Context  
A content-creator studio wants to mass-produce high-engagement **vertical videos** (Reels / Shorts / TikToks) with **zero** human effort. Your job is to build an **end-to-end automation pipeline** in **n8n** that ideates a topic, generates all media assets, assembles a 9 : 16 video, and publishes it on **Instagram, TikTok, _and_ YouTube Shorts**—all without manual intervention.

## Your automation in n8n should do the following

| Level | Scope |
|-------|-------|
| **Level 1** | • Accept a **user-assigned prompt**.<br>• Generate a 9 : 16 video from that prompt.<br>• Publish the video to **Instagram** with autogenerated hashtags. |
| **Level 2** | • Everything in Level 1 **plus**:<br>  – Automated voice-over (text-to-speech).<br>  – Background music integration.<br>  – On-screen captions timed to the narration. |
| **Level 3** | • Everything in Level 2 **plus**:<br>  – Cross-post the finished video to **TikTok** and **YouTube Shorts** (three platforms total). |
| **Level 4** | • Everything in Level 3 **plus**:<br>  – Fully automated content creation chain:<br>     *GPT text-to-script* → *text-to-video* → *text-to-audio* → *text-to-music* → *text-to-captions* → *text-to-hashtags*—all prompts generated and executed without user input. |
| **Level 5** | • Everything in Level 4 **plus**:<br>  – **Autonomous topic selection** using popularity/trending data from public sources (e.g., Google Trends, social-media trending endpoints). |

## Technical Constraints

* The entire workflow must run on a **local workstation**; no paid cloud runtimes required.  
* All critical steps (topic discovery, script/asset generation, editing, publishing) must be done inside **n8n** using built-in nodes, HTTP calls, or command executions (FFmpeg, etc.).  
* **Free or open-source services must be supported**; paid APIs (e.g., ElevenLabs, RunwayML) may be offered as optional fallbacks.  
* The final workflow must be reproducible from a fresh install with minimal environment configuration.

## Deliverables

1. **`workflow.json`** – the n8n workflow export, ready to import.  
2. **`README.md`** (≤ 2 pages) – minimal setup guide detailing required environment variables, API keys, setting-up local n8n, and how to run the workflow.  
3. **Demo** – screen-capture or live presentation showing a full run that ends with a live or unlisted post on each required platform.  
4. **(Optional)** Source-asset cache (sample generated scripts, audio, images) for verification.

**Build it, hit Run, and watch fully-automated content go live on all three platforms. Good luck!**
